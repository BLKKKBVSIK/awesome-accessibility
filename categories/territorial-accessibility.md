# Territorial Accessibility

### Do

- **Optimize for Low Bandwidth**: Design your app to function efficiently on slower network connections.
- **Support Older Devices**: Ensure compatibility with older operating systems and hardware.
- **Minimize App Size**: Keep the download size small to make it more accessible for users with limited data plans.
- **Reduce Dependency on High-End Features**: Avoid relying on the latest device features that may not be available in all territories.

### Don't

- **Exclude Users with Older Devices**: Don't design your app solely for the latest devices, excluding a significant user base.
- **Neglect Data Usage Concerns**: Avoid designing apps that require large amounts of data to function properly, which may not be feasible in all regions.
- **Overlook Offline Capabilities**: Do not forget to include offline functionality for users with intermittent internet access.
